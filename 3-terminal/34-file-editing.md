Here are two commonly used text editors.

* `nano`/`pico`, is an intuitive, i.e. less complex, text editor. The most commonly used commands, like "Exit" \("Ctrl"+"x"\), are listed at the bottom of the editor. To start editing a file, e.g. named as "myfile.txt", just type`$ nano myfile.txt`in the terminal.![](/assets/g.png)
* `vim` \([http://www.vim.org\](http://www.vim.org\)\) is a more-advanced and powerful, yet more complex, text editor. It takes time to get familiar with the controls, hence you are recommended to learn it in your spare time.
