# File management {#file-management}

Here are some examples on basic file management.

\(Note that the commands are in one single line, i.e. don't break them into multiple lines!\)

* Change directory, e.g. change to a subdirectory called "mydir":`$cd mydir`.
  * Change to the parent \(upper\) folder:`$cd ..`
  * Change to the previous folder:`$cd -`
  * Change to your home directory:`$cd ~`
    or solely`$cd`
* Create directory, e.g. create a directory named "mydir":
  `$ mkdir mydir`
* List files, e.g. in the directory "mydir":
  `$ ls mydir`
* Create an empty file, e.g. create a file named "myfile":
  `$ touch myfile`
* Copy files, e.g. copy a file named "myfile" as "myfile\_copy":
  `$ cp myfile myfile_copy`
* Move files, e.g. move a file named "myfile\_copy" into directory "mydir":
  `$ mv myfile_copy mydir/myfile_copy`
* Rename files, e.g. rename a file named "myfile" into "myfile1":
  `$ mv myfile myfile1`
* Remove files \(use with caution!!\), e.g. remove a file named "myfile1":
  `$ rm myfile1`
