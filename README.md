# Linux Basic {#linux-basic}

In this lab, we will go through the steps to setup a virtual machine \(VM\) on your own computer. This allows you to work in a Linux environment, regardless of the operating system \(OS\) running on your computer. We call the OS running on your computer the _host OS_, and the OS running in an VM the _guest OS_. Also, we include some basics of Linux and VirtualBox, which hopefully prepare you to work in a Linux environment.
