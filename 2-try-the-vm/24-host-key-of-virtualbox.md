# Host key of VirtualBox \(Important!!\) {#host-key-of-virtualbox-important}

VirtualBox uses the right "Ctrl" key as the Host key by default, as shown at the bottom right-hand corner of the VM's window. By pressing the "Host key", you may attach/detach your input devices to/from the VM.**When you intend to press/issue "Ctrl" inside the VM, use the left "Ctrl" instead of the right one to avoid confusion.**
