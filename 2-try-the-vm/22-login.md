# Login to VM {#login-to-vm}

#### Login {#login}

Wait while the machine and OS boots. You will be automatically login to the linux. If you need the credential, they are:

**Username:**csci3150

**Password:**csci3150

Note: the username and password are both csci3150 because this machine was used in CSCI3150 class before! We do not change it because the information in the picture of our lab are all related to csci3150. Changing it will make students confusing. So csci3150 in our class has no special meaning, it is just the username and password of your machine. 

After login, you will see a desktop, with the taskbar at the top.![](/assets/9.png)And now we have finished setting up a VM running Linux.
