### Turning the screen resolution of your VM {#turning-the-screen-resolution-of-your-vm}

Coding on a screen with low resolution, e.g. 640 x 480, can be painful... Fortunately, VirtualBox VMs are able to adjust their screen resolution according to the window size after installing the "Guest Additions".

Follow the steps to install "Guest Additions" in the File Transfer-&gt;[Install the Virtualbox Addons](https://eric-lo.github.io/3150/1-Linux/install-the-virtualbox-addons.html)\(if you haven't done so\). Reboot the VM after installation, and try resizing the VM's window to a customized size :\)
